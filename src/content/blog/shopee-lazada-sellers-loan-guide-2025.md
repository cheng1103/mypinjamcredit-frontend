## Why Traditional Banks Reject Online Sellers {#why-rejection}

### Common Rejection Reasons

**1. No Physical Business Address**
- Banks want shop rental agreement
- Home-based businesses seen as "risky"
- P.O. Box addresses not accepted

**2. Inconsistent Income**
```
January: RM15,000 sales
February: RM8,000 sales (CNY slowdown)
March: RM25,000 sales (payday season)
April: RM12,000 sales

Banks see this as "unstable income"
```

**3. Cannot Prove Business Legitimacy**
- No SSM business registration (some sellers)
- No proper accounting records
- Sales data only in Shopee/Lazada dashboard

**4. Young Business Age**
- Banks want 2-3 years track record
- Many online sellers started recently (2022-2024)

**5. Low Profit Margins**
- E-commerce margins often 10-20%
- Banks prefer 30-40% margin businesses

**But don't worry! Alternative financing options exist for you.**

```

**Time to Improve:** Typically 6-12 months of good payment behavior

---

**7. Prepare Cashflow Projection**

**What is Cashflow Projection?**
- A forecast of your income and expenses for next 12 months
- Shows lenders you can afford repayment

**Sample Monthly Cashflow Projection:**

```
Revenue:
  Shopee sales: RM40,000

  Total: RM75,000

  Total: RM57,750

Net Profit: RM17,250 (23%)

Loan Repayment:
  RM5,000/month (requested RM200K over 4 years)

Net Cash After Loan: RM12,250 ✅ (Positive = can afford!)
```

**Include this in your loan application!**

---

**8. Start Small, Build Credit**

**Strategy:**

**Phase 1: First Small Loan**
- Apply for RM10,000 - RM30,000
- Higher approval rate
- Repay perfectly for 6-12 months

**Phase 2: Top-Up or New Loan**
- Apply for larger amount (RM50,000 - RM100,000)
- Lenders see your good repayment history
- Better interest rates offered

**Phase 3: Major Expansion Loan**
- Apply for RM200,000+
- Strong business credit built
- Multiple lenders competing for your business!

**Example:**
"Ah Liang from Johor Bahru started with RM20K from Funding Societies in 2022. Repaid perfectly. In 2023, got RM80K. In 2024, approved for RM300K at better rate!"

---

**9. Use Collateral if Necessary**

**What Can Be Used as Collateral for E-commerce Loans?**

| Collateral Type | Loan Amount Can Get | Notes |
|----------------|---------------------|-------|
| **House (residential)** | Up to 70% of property value | Lowest interest rates |
| **Commercial property** | Up to 60% of value | Good for large loans (RM500K+) |
| **Fixed Deposit** | Up to 90% of FD value | Keep FD while getting loan |
| **ASB/ASN (for Bumiputera)** | Up to 70% of unit value | Low interest |
| **Car** | Up to 80% of market value | Higher interest |
| **Inventory stock** | Up to 50% of value | Must be verifiable |

**Secured Loans = Lower Interest Rates**

**Example:**
```
Without collateral: 15% p.a. interest
With house as collateral: 5-7% p.a. interest

RM200K loan over 5 years:
- Unsecured: Pay ~RM90K interest
- Secured: Pay ~RM35K interest
- Savings: RM55,000! 💰
```

## FAQ {#faq}

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: I sell on Shopee but not registered with SSM. Can I still get loan?**

**A:**
- **Platform financing (Shopee Capital, LazCapital):** Sometimes yes, but approval rate lower
- **Traditional banks:** No, must have SSM
- **Fintech (Funding Societies, BOOST):** Usually require SSM

**Recommendation:** Register with SSM first (only RM30-RM60!). Will save you lots of trouble.

---

**Q2: My sales fluctuate a lot. Will I get rejected?**

**A:**
It depends on WHY sales fluctuate:

**Acceptable Fluctuations:**
- Seasonal products (CNY, Raya, Christmas)
- Big sale events (11.11, 12.12, payday sales)

**Red Flag Fluctuations:**
- Random spikes and drops with no pattern
- Declining trend month-over-month

**Tips to Reduce Fluctuation:**
- Diversify product range
- Run promotions during slow months
- Build subscription/repeat customer model

---

**Q3: How much can I borrow based on my monthly sales?**

**Rule of Thumb:**

```
Monthly Sales RM20,000 = Can borrow RM50,000 - RM100,000
Monthly Sales RM50,000 = Can borrow RM100,000 - RM250,000
Monthly Sales RM100,000 = Can borrow RM250,000 - RM500,000
```

**But also depends on:**
- Profit margin (higher = can borrow more)
- Business age (longer = more)
- Credit score (better = more)
- Collateral (with = much more)

---

**Q4: Which is better - Shopee Capital or bank loan?**

**Comparison:**

| Factor | Shopee Capital | Bank Loan |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Approval Speed** | 1-2 days ✅ | 1-4 weeks ❌ |
| **Interest Rate** | 12-18% p.a. | 5-10% p.a. ✅ |
| **Approval Rate** | High ✅ | Low ❌ |
| **Max Amount** | RM200,000 | RM500,000+ ✅ |
| **Documents** | Minimal ✅ | Extensive ❌ |
| **Flexibility** | Auto-deduct from sales ✅ | Fixed monthly ❌ |

**Use Shopee Capital if:**
- Need money urgently (within days)
- Don't have SSM or strong credit
- Loan amount below RM200K

**Use Bank Loan if:**
- Need large amount (RM500K+)
- Want lowest interest rate
- Have strong credit and SSM

**Or use BOTH:** Many sellers use Shopee Capital for short-term needs, bank loan for big expansion!

---

**Q5: I'm not Bumiputera. Can I get TEKUN or MARA?**

**A:**
- **TEKUN:** Only for Bumiputera (Malays and Orang Asli)
- **MARA:** Only for Bumiputera

**Alternatives for Non-Bumiputera:**
- **SME Bank** - Open to all races
- **CGC BizMula** - Open to all races
- **Funding Societies** - Open to all
- **BOOST Capital** - Open to all
- **Bank loans** - Open to all

---

**Q6: Can I use loan money for personal expenses?**

**A:** **Not recommended!**

**Why:**
- Lenders want to see business ROI
- Personal expenses don't generate income to repay loan
- May violate loan agreement (business loan must use for business)

**If Need Personal Money:**
- Apply for personal loan separately (different product)
- Or take director's salary from business profit

**If Caught Misusing Business Loan:**
- Bank can demand immediate full repayment
- Blacklisted from future financing
- Legal action possible

---

**Q7: What if I can't repay loan on time?**

**A:**

**Step 1: Contact Lender IMMEDIATELY**
- Don't wait until default
- Call 1-2 weeks before payment due
- Explain situation honestly

**Step 2: Request Restructuring**
- Extend tenure (lower monthly payment)
- Payment holiday (1-3 months grace period)
- Reduce monthly amount temporarily

**Most lenders willing to work with you if you're proactive!**

**What NOT to Do:**
- ❌ Ignore lender's calls
- ❌ Hide and hope problem goes away
- ❌ Borrow from Ah Long to pay legal lender
- ❌ Let it default and ruin your credit

---

**Q8: Can I apply for multiple loans at once?**

**A:**

**Best Practice:** Apply to maximum 2-3 lenders at once

**Why:**
- Each application = CCRIS inquiry = reduces credit score
- Too many inquiries = red flag for lenders
- If one approves, others may reject seeing multiple applications

**Strategy:**
```
Week 1: Apply to top choice lender (wait for decision)
Week 2: If rejected, apply to 2nd choice
Week 3: If still rejected, seek professional help (Money Line Solutions)
```

**Exception:** Platform financing (Shopee Capital, LazCapital) doesn't affect CCRIS as much. Can apply simultaneously.

---

**Q9: How long does it take to build good enough credit for loan?**

**A:**

**If Starting from Zero:**
- Get credit card (even RM2,000 limit is fine)
- Use and pay on time for 6 months
- Apply for small personal loan (RM5,000), repay perfectly
- After 12 months, credit score improves significantly

**If Recovering from Bad Credit:**
- Settle all outstanding debts
- Wait 6-12 months of clean payment history
- CTOS score will gradually improve
- May take 12-24 months to fully recover

**Shortcut:**
- Use guarantor or collateral (bypasses credit score requirement)

---

**Q10: Is it worth it to hire loan consultant?**

**A:**

**Worth It If:**
✅ You've been rejected 2+ times
✅ You need large amount (RM200K+)
✅ You have complex business structure (multiple entities, cross-border)
✅ You're too busy to handle applications
✅ You want best rates (consultant can negotiate)

**Not Worth It If:**
- Loan amount very small (below RM20K)
- You have perfect credit and just need simple platform financing
- You enjoy DIY and have time to research

**Money Line Solutions Fees:**
- Free consultation
- Success fee: 1-3% of approved loan amount
- Example: RM100K loan = RM1,000 - RM3,000 fee
- **Only pay if approved!**
