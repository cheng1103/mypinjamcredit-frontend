## Common Mistakes to Avoid {#mistakes}

### ❌ Mistake 1: Not Getting Proper Quotations

**Why It's Bad:**
- No clear scope of work
- Contractor can claim extras
- Budget blowout
- Disputes over payments

**Example:**
- Verbal agreement: "Paint whole house RM5,000"
- Mid-work: "Oh, ceiling not included, add RM3,000"
- Surprise costs keep adding

**Solution:**
✅ Get detailed written quotation
✅ Specify every single item
✅ Include materials, labor breakdown
✅ No verbal agreements
✅ Sign quotation before work starts

### ❌ Mistake 2: Paying Full Amount Upfront

**Why It's Dangerous:**
- Contractor may disappear
- No leverage if work unsatisfactory
- Hard to get money back
- Quality issues ignored

**Horror Story:**
- Paid RM80,000 upfront
- Contractor did 30% work
- Disappeared with money
- Legal case ongoing, money unrecovered

**Solution:**
✅ **Progressive payment schedule:**
  - Deposit: 10-20%
  - 1st progress: 30% (after 30% work done)
  - 2nd progress: 30% (after 60% work done)
  - 3rd progress: 20% (after 90% work done)
  - Final: 10% (after 100% completion + defects fixed)

### ❌ Mistake 3: Choosing Cheapest Contractor

**Why It's Bad:**
- Poor quality materials
- Unskilled workers
- Shortcuts taken
- Re-do costs more expensive

**Example:**
- Contractor A: RM60,000 (experienced, good reviews)
- Contractor B: RM40,000 (new, no track record) ← Chosen
- Result: Poor tiling, leaking bathroom, rewire needed
- Re-do cost: RM25,000
- Total: RM65,000 (more expensive!)

**Solution:**
✅ Check contractor background
✅ Ask for references
✅ View past projects
✅ Read online reviews
✅ Verify PKK/CIDB registration
✅ Don't choose based on price alone

### ❌ Mistake 4: No Written Contract

**Why It's Bad:**
- No legal protection
- Verbal promises forgotten
- Dispute resolution difficult
- Hard to claim warranty

**What Should Be in Contract:**
- Detailed scope of work
- Materials specifications (brands, models)
- Timeline with milestones
- Payment schedule
- Warranty terms (usually 12 months)
- Penalty for delays
- Dispute resolution process

**Solution:**
✅ Always have written contract
✅ Both parties sign and date
✅ Keep original copy
✅ Refer to contract throughout project

### ❌ Mistake 5: Over-Borrowing

**Why It's Bad:**
- Monthly installment too high
- Financial stress
- Affects future borrowing (DSR)
- May lead to default

**Example:**
- Borrow: RM150,000 (renovation + furniture)
- Monthly: RM1,500
- Income: RM5,000
- DSR: 30% just for this loan
- Cannot afford housing upgrade later

**Solution:**
✅ Borrow only for renovation works
✅ Save for furniture/appliances
✅ Keep DSR below 40% total
✅ Calculate affordability before applying
✅ Have emergency fund separate

- Credit score problems
- Need local authority approval

**Tip:** Start application process 2-3 months before planned renovation start date

### Should I refinance my home loan to get renovation funds?

**It Can Be a Good Option If:**
✅ You have significant equity in property
✅ Current home loan interest rate is high
✅ Want to consolidate other debts too
✅ Need large amount (> RM200,000)
✅ Want longest possible repayment period

**Example:**

**Your Situation:**
- Property value: RM600,000
- Existing home loan: RM250,000
- Equity: RM350,000
- Renovation needed: RM100,000

**Refinancing Option:**
- New loan: RM350,000 (250k existing + 100k renovation)
- Interest: 3.5% (lower than renovation loan 4.5%)
- Tenure: 30 years
- Monthly: RM1,571

**VS Keeping Separate Loans:**
- Home loan: RM250,000 @ 4.0% = RM1,193/month
- Renovation loan: RM100,000 @ 4.5% (10 years) = RM1,036/month
- Total: RM2,229/month

**Refinancing Saves:** RM658/month

**BUT Consider:**
- Legal fees: RM5,000 - RM10,000
- Valuation fees: RM500 - RM1,000
- Stamp duty: 0.5% of loan
- Early settlement penalty on existing loan: 2-3%
- Paying renovation debt over 30 years (higher total interest)

**When NOT to Refinance:**
- Happy with current home loan rate
- Don't want to extend debt repayment period
- High upfront costs
- Planning to sell property soon

**Better Alternative:**
Separate renovation loan if amount is manageable (< RM100,000)

### What happens if the renovation goes over budget?

**Common Scenario:**
- Loan approved: RM80,000
- Actual costs: RM95,000
- Shortfall: RM15,000

**Options:**

**1. Pay from Savings**
- Best option if you have emergency fund
- No additional debt
- Complete project as planned

**2. Apply for Top-Up Loan**
- Request additional RM15,000
- Bank reassesses affordability
- May approve if DSR allows
- Processing time: 2-4 weeks
- Additional legal fees

**3. Personal Loan Top-Up**
- Quick approval (3-7 days)
- Higher interest rate
- Smaller amount
- No collateral needed

**4. Reduce Renovation Scope**
- Most practical if overbudget is large
- Postpone non-essential works
- Prioritize must-haves
- Complete Phase 2 later

**How to Avoid:**
✅ Add 20% buffer to initial budget
✅ Get fixed price quotation (not estimate)
✅ Avoid mid-project changes
✅ Have emergency fund separate
✅ Don't commit to unnecessary upgrades

**Example:**
- Estimated budget: RM80,000
- Apply for loan: RM96,000 (RM80k + 20%)
- Actual cost: RM88,000
- Extra: RM8,000 for defects/touch-ups
- No stress, project completed smoothly
