## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I use personal loan for business?
**A:** Yes, but not recommended for large amounts or long-term business needs. Tax implications and interest rates make business loans better for serious business investments.

### Q: Will business loan affect personal DSR?
**A:** Depends. If you provide personal guarantee (common), it may affect DSR. Pure business loans without personal guarantee don't.

### Q: How to convert personal loan to business loan?
**A:**
1. Register your business
2. Build 12-24 months track record
3. Apply for business loan
4. Use proceeds to settle personal loan
5. Ensure no early settlement penalties

### Q: Which has better interest rates?
**A:** Usually personal loans have better *advertised* rates, but business loans have better *effective* rates after tax deductions.

### Q: Can I get both loans simultaneously?
**A:** Yes, but total DSR must be manageable (< 60%). Banks evaluate combined obligations.
