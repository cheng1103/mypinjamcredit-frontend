### Interest Rate Comparison Example

**For RM500,000 loan over 30 years:**

| Interest Rate | Monthly Payment | Total Interest Paid |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 4.00% | RM2,387 | RM359,347 |
| 4.50% | RM2,533 | RM411,804 |
| 5.00% | RM2,684 | RM466,279 |

**Savings**: 0.5% difference = RM146 monthly, RM52,600 over 30 years!

## How Much Can You Borrow?

### Maximum Loan Amount

**Formula**: Smaller of:
1. 90% of property value (first property)
2. Amount based on your DSR calculation

### DSR (Debt Service Ratio) Calculation

**Bank Negara Malaysia Rules:**
- **DSR limit**: 70% for properties above RM600,000
- **DSR limit**: No restriction for properties below RM600,000

**Formula:**
```
DSR = (Monthly Debt Obligations ÷ Gross Monthly Income) × 100
```

**Example Calculation:**

Ahmad earns RM8,000/month and has:
- Car loan: RM800/month
- Personal loan: RM500/month
- Credit card minimum: RM200/month

```
Existing commitments = RM1,500
Maximum DSR allowed = 70%
Maximum total debt = RM8,000 × 70% = RM5,600
Available for housing = RM5,600 - RM1,500 = RM4,100/month
```

At 4.5% interest for 30 years, Ahmad can borrow approximately **RM810,000**.

### Loan Amount by Income Level

| Monthly Income | Max Monthly Payment (70% DSR) | Max Loan Amount (4.5%, 30 years) |
|---------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| RM3,000 | RM2,100 | RM415,000 |
| RM5,000 | RM3,500 | RM690,000 |
| RM8,000 | RM5,600 | RM1,105,000 |
| RM10,000 | RM7,000 | RM1,380,000 |
