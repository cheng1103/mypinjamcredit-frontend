**If Sdn Bhd:**
- Must file Form C (company tax)
- Must have audited accounts if revenue > RM500K/year

**Why Important for Loan:**
- Proof of legitimate business operations

- Banks check tax compliance via LHDN portal

---

**6. Get All Necessary Licenses BEFORE Applying Loan**

**Essential Licenses:**

```

✅ Food establishment license (from health dept)
✅ Premise license (from Fire Dept for safety compliance)
✅ Halal certificate (if serving Muslims)
✅ Signboard license
✅ Entertainment license (if have live music/TV)
```

**Banks will check!** No licenses = automatic rejection.

---

**7. Maintain Strong Credit Score (CTOS & CCRIS)**

**Check Your Scores:**

**CTOS:**
- Check at: https://www.ctosdigital.com
- Cost: RM39.90
- Target score: Above 700 (for good approval chances)

**CCRIS (Free!):**
- Check at: https://www.bnm.gov.my
- Register for online access
- Look for any defaults or late payments

**How to Improve:**
- Pay all existing loans on time
- Settle outstanding credit card debt
- Don't apply for too many loans at once
- Dispute any errors in report

---

**8. Prepare Solid Business Plan**

**See detailed template in section below!**

Key elements:
- Executive summary
- Market analysis (who are your customers?)
- Competition analysis
- Menu & pricing strategy
- Revenue projections (realistic!)
- Expense breakdown
- Loan usage plan
- Repayment ability

**Pro Tip:** Use actual operating data (if existing restaurant), not just projections!

---

**9. Offer Collateral to Get Better Rates**

**Collateral Options:**

| Type | Loan-to-Value | Interest Rate Reduction |
|------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Residential property** | Up to 70% | Save 2-5% p.a. |
| **Commercial property** | Up to 60% | Save 2-4% p.a. |
| **Fixed Deposit** | Up to 90% | Save 3-6% p.a. |
| **ASB/ASN units (Bumiputera)** | Up to 70% | Save 2-4% p.a. |

**Example:**

```
RM300,000 loan for 5 years:

Without collateral:
- Interest: 12% p.a.
- Total interest paid: RM105,000

With property collateral:
- Interest: 6% p.a.
- Total interest paid: RM50,000

**Savings: RM55,000!** 💰
```

---

**10. Get Personal Guarantee from Strong Guarantor**

**If you don't have property, use guarantor:**

**Good Guarantor Profiles:**
- Parent or sibling working in government
- Spouse with professional job (doctor, engineer, accountant)
- Business partner with clean credit
- Anyone with high income (RM10,000+) and clean CCRIS

**Guarantor Requirements:**
- Clean CTOS/CCRIS (no bankruptcy)
- Stable income
- Willing to sign legal guarantee
- Understand they'll pay if you default

---

**11. Start with Smaller Loan, Build Credit**

**Phased Borrowing Strategy:**

```
Phase 1 (Year 1):
- Open small restaurant with personal savings
- Take RM50,000 working capital loan
- Repay perfectly for 12 months

Phase 2 (Year 2):
- Apply for RM150,000 expansion loan (2nd branch)
- Banks see good repayment track record
- Higher approval rate, better interest rate

Phase 3 (Year 3-4):
- Apply for RM500,000 major expansion (3-5 branches)
- Strong business credit built
- Banks compete for your business!
```

---

**12. Partner with Suppliers (Trade Credit)**

**What is Trade Credit?**
- Suppliers give you ingredients/supplies NOW
- You pay them 30-60 days later
- Free credit! (if no interest charged)

**How to Negotiate:**
```
✅ Build relationship with supplier for 3-6 months first
✅ Pay on time every delivery
✅ After trust built, ask for 30-day credit terms
✅ Gradually increase credit limit
```

**Example:**
"Lim's Steamboat Restaurant in Puchong buys RM20,000 seafood monthly. Supplier now gives 45-day credit. That's RM30,000 working capital saved!"

---

**13. Reduce Personal Debts Before Applying**

**Calculate Debt Service Ratio (DSR):**

```
DSR = (Total Monthly Debt + Proposed Loan) ÷ Total Monthly Income × 100%
```

**Banks want DSR below 70% (some banks 60%)**

**If DSR Too High, Do This:**
- Settle small debts first (credit cards, personal loans)
- Extend existing loan tenures (reduce monthly payment)
- Increase business revenue before applying

---

**14. Time Your Application Strategically**

**Best Times to Apply:**

| Period | Why Good? |
|--------|-----------|
| **After Festival Season (CNY, Raya, Deepavali)** | You have strong sales figures to show |
| **Government Budget Announcement (October-November)** | New SME schemes launched |
| **Start of Year (January-March)** | Banks have fresh lending targets |

**Avoid:**
- Year-end (November-December) - Banks rushing to close books
- Peak audit season (April-June) - Slow processing

---

**15. Get Professional Loan Consultant Help**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid {#common-mistakes}

### Top 10 Mistakes F&B Owners Make When Applying for Loans

**Mistake #1: Applying Without Proper Business Registration**

❌ **Wrong:** "I operate food stall, no need SSM registration."

✅ **Right:** Register with SSM BEFORE applying for loan. Cost only RM30-RM60, mandatory for business loans.

---

**Mistake #2: Mixing Personal and Business Finances**

❌ **Wrong:** Use personal bank account for business sales, mix grocery shopping with business purchases.

✅ **Right:** Separate business bank account. Clean records = easier loan approval.

---

**Mistake #3: Over-Estimating Sales Projections**

❌ **Wrong:**
```
Business plan claims:
- Daily sales: RM10,000
- Monthly sales: RM300,000
- Profit margin: 50%

(Banks know typical F&B is RM50K-RM150K monthly, 20-30% margin. They'll reject unrealistic projections!)
```

✅ **Right:** Use realistic, conservative numbers based on industry benchmarks.

---

**Mistake #4: Under-Estimating Startup Costs**

❌ **Wrong:**
```
"I need RM100,000 to open restaurant."

Reality Check:
- Deposit: RM15K
- Renovation: RM80K
- Equipment: RM60K
- Initial stock: RM15K
- Licenses: RM8K
- Working capital: RM40K
- ACTUAL NEED: RM218,000!

Applied RM100K, not enough, business struggled.
```

✅ **Right:** Calculate ALL costs including working capital buffer. Better to borrow more than needed than run out of cash!

---

**Mistake #5: Ignoring Existing Debt Service Ratio**

❌ **Wrong:** Already have car loan + credit card debt totaling RM3,000/month. Apply for restaurant loan with RM4,000/month payment. Total RM7,000/month debt but income only RM8,000. Bank rejects (DSR too high).

✅ **Right:** Clear high-interest debts first, or factor existing commitments into affordability.

---

**Mistake #6: Not Having Licenses Before Applying**

❌ **Wrong:** "I'll get licenses after loan approved."

**Bank:** "No licenses = loan rejected."

✅ **Right:** Get at least business license and food license FIRST. Banks check compliance.

---

**Mistake #7: Applying to Too Many Banks at Once**

❌ **Wrong:** Apply to 8 banks simultaneously. Each inquiry shows on CCRIS. Credit score drops. Banks see desperate pattern. All reject.

✅ **Right:** Apply to maximum 2-3 lenders. If rejected, seek professional help to understand why and fix issues before next application.

---

**Mistake #8: Hiding Negative Information**

❌ **Wrong:** Have previous bankruptcy but don't declare. Bank finds out during credit check. Automatic rejection + blacklisted.

✅ **Right:** Be transparent. If have issues, explain and show how you've resolved them. Banks appreciate honesty.

---

**Mistake #9: Not Having Clear Loan Purpose**

❌ **Wrong:**
```
Bank: "What will you use this RM200K for?"
You: "Umm... business expenses lah..."
Bank: "Can you be more specific?"
You: "Just... general use..."
```

**Result:** REJECTED (Banks think you'll misuse funds)

✅ **Right:**
```
"RM200,000 breakdown:
- Kitchen equipment: RM80,000 (attach quotations)
- Renovation: RM70,000 (contractor quote attached)
- Initial stock: RM20,000
- Working capital: RM30,000

Expected ROI: Sales RM120K/month, profit RM30K/month, can repay RM5K/month comfortably."
```

**Result:** Banks see you're serious, detailed, know what you're doing. APPROVED.

---

**Mistake #10: Choosing Loan Based on Amount Only (Not Total Cost)**

❌ **Wrong:**
```
Lender A: RM150,000 @ 8% p.a. for 5 years = RM33,000 interest
Lender B: RM180,000 @ 15% p.a. for 5 years = RM75,000 interest

Choose B because "got more money!"

But pay RM42,000 MORE in interest! 😱
```

✅ **Right:** Compare TOTAL COST (principal + interest). Sometimes smaller amount with lower rate is smarter.

```

**Note:** First 6 months may have lower profit due to building customer base. We project breakeven by month 4.

**5.4 Loan Repayment Ability**

```
Loan Amount: RM350,000
Interest Rate: 6% p.a. (assuming SME Bank)
Tenure: 10 years (120 months)
Monthly Payment: RM3,885

Debt Service Coverage Ratio:
Monthly Net Profit: RM23,800
Loan Payment: RM3,885
DSCR: 23,800 ÷ 3,885 = 6.13x

(DSCR > 1.25 is good. Ours is 6.13x = VERY SAFE!)

Even if sales drop 50%, we can still repay loan comfortably.

## FAQ {#faq}

**Q1: What's the minimum operating history needed to get restaurant loan?**

**A:**
- **Government schemes (TEKUN, MARA):** Can apply even if NEW (0 months)
- **Bank Rakyat, Islamic banks:** Minimum 6 months
- **Commercial banks (Maybank, CIMB, RHB):** Minimum 1-2 years
- **SME Bank:** Minimum 1 year (prefer 2+ years)

**If you're new:** Start with personal savings, operate 6-12 months, then apply for expansion loan.

---

**Q2: Can I get loan if my restaurant is home-based (no shopfront)?**

**A:**
It's VERY difficult because:
- Banks want proper business address
- Home-based seen as hobby, not serious business
- Licensing issues (residential areas have restrictions)

**Exceptions:**
- Online food business (cookies, cakes with delivery only) - can use fintech lenders like Funding Societies
- Home-based catering (if have proper licenses) - try TEKUN or AIM

**Recommendation:** If serious about restaurant business, rent proper commercial premises.

---

**Q3: Do I need halal certification to get loan?**

**A:**
**Not mandatory for loan approval BUT:**

**Advantages of having halal cert:**
- Larger customer base (Muslim + non-Muslim)
- Some banks give priority/better rates (especially Islamic banks)
- Can participate in government programs (TEKUN, MARA require halal)
- Can supply to government offices, Islamic institutions

**If not halal certified:**
- Still can get commercial bank loans
- Clearly state in business plan your target market (non-Muslim or multi-cultural)

---

**Q4: How long does restaurant loan approval take?**

**A:**

| Lender Type | Typical Approval Time |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **TEKUN** | 2-4 weeks |
| **MARA** | 4-8 weeks |
| **SME Bank** | 3-6 weeks |
| **Bank Rakyat** | 1-2 weeks |
| **Maybank, CIMB, RHB** | 2-4 weeks |
| **Fintech (Funding Societies)** | 2-5 days |

**Tips to speed up:**
- Submit COMPLETE documents (don't miss anything)
- Respond quickly to bank queries
- Have accountant on standby to explain financials
- Use loan consultant to chase bank (we know the process!)

---

**Q5: Can I get loan for food truck or stall (not full restaurant)?**

**A:** **YES!**

**Food Truck Financing:**
- TEKUN Mikro/Madani: RM10,000 - RM50,000
- Bank equipment financing: RM50,000 - RM150,000 (finance the truck itself)
- Hire purchase: Buy truck with HP (easier than business loan)

**Food Stall:**
- TEKUN: RM5,000 - RM30,000
- AIM (if can form group): RM1,000 - RM20,000
- Microcredit lenders: RM10,000 - RM50,000

---

**Q6: What if I want to buy existing restaurant (not start new)?**

**A:**
**Takeover/Acquisition Financing:**

**What you need:**
- Business valuation (how much is existing restaurant worth?)
- Sales & purchase agreement
- Existing restaurant's financial records (last 2-3 years)
- Reason for seller selling (retirement, relocation, etc.)

**Financing Options:**
- SME Bank: Up to 70% of purchase price
- Commercial banks: 50-60% of purchase price
- You need 30-50% downpayment from own funds

**Due Diligence (VERY IMPORTANT!):**
```
✅ Check actual sales (not just what seller claims)
✅ Review expenses (any hidden costs?)
✅ Verify licenses (transferable?)
✅ Check lease (how many years left? Can renew?)
✅ Staff situation (will they stay or leave?)
✅ Equipment condition (need replacement soon?)
✅ Debt/liabilities (seller must clear before transfer)
```

**Recommendation:** Hire business valuer (cost RM2,000-RM5,000). Worth it to avoid overpaying!

---

**Q7: Can I use restaurant loan to renovate residential property for restaurant use?**

**A:**
**Generally NO, because:**
- Residential property has zoning restrictions
- Need change of use approval (VERY hard to get!)
- Banks won't finance illegal/non-compliant ventures

**Exception:**
- Some ground floor residential in mixed-use buildings can apply for commercial license
- Must get local council approval FIRST
- Then banks may consider

**Recommendation:** Rent proper commercial premises, don't risk legal issues.

---

**Q8: What if I default on restaurant loan?**

**A:**
**Consequences:**

**Short-term (1-3 months default):**
- Bank calls and sends letters
- Late payment charges added
- CCRIS record updated (shows arrears)

**Medium-term (3-6 months):**
- Account classified as NPL (non-performing loan)
- Bank may appoint debt collector
- Credit score drops significantly
- Difficult to get future loans

**Long-term (6+ months):**
- Bank takes legal action
- If have collateral: Bank sells your property/assets
- If have guarantor: Guarantor must pay
- May lead to bankruptcy
- Business closure

**What to Do If Can't Repay:**
1. Contact bank IMMEDIATELY (don't hide!)
2. Request for restructuring:
   - Extend tenure (reduce monthly payment)
   - Payment moratorium (3-6 months grace period)
   - Reduce interest rate
3. Show willingness to resolve (propose payment plan)
4. Seek professional help (credit counselor, MyPinjam Credit can mediate with bank)
