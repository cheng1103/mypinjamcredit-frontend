## How to Improve Approval Chances {#improve-approval}

### 10 Tips for Estate Workers

**1. Improve Your CTOS Score**

**Check Your CTOS Score First:**
- Go to: https://www.ctosdigital.com
- Pay RM39.90 for score report
- See what's affecting your score

**How to Improve CTOS Score:**
```
✅ Pay ALL outstanding hire purchase on time
✅ Settle small debts first (RM500-RM1,000)
✅ Don't apply for multiple loans at once
✅ Wait 6 months after rejection before reapplying
✅ Check for errors in CTOS report (dispute if wrong)
```

**Estate Worker Success Story:**
"Kumar from Klang estate had CTOS score of 480. He paid off his motorcycle arrears (RM800), waited 3 months, and his score improved to 620. Then Bank Rakyat approved his RM15,000 loan!"

---

**2. Show Regular Income Pattern**

**What Banks Want to See:**
- Consistent monthly deposits in your bank account
- Same amount every month (or similar)
- வங்கியில் சம்பளம் வரவேண்டும் (Salary must deposit in bank)

**If You Get Cash Salary:**
- Deposit cash into YOUR bank account on same date every month
- Do this for at least 3-6 months before applying
- Banks will see the pattern

**Example:**
```
January: RM2,500 deposit (5th)
February: RM2,500 deposit (5th)
March: RM2,500 deposit (5th)
April: RM2,500 deposit (5th)
May: RM2,500 deposit (5th)
June: RM2,500 deposit (5th)

This shows REGULAR INCOME PATTERN!
```

---

**3. Apply with Co-Borrower**

**What is Co-Borrower?**
- Another person who applies with you
- Banks look at BOTH incomes combined
- இருவரின் சம்பளமும் சேர்க்கப்படும் (Both salaries combined)

**Who Can Be Co-Borrower?**
- Spouse (husband/wife)
- Parent (father/mother)
- Sibling (brother/sister)
- Close friend

**Example:**
```
Your salary: RM2,000
Spouse salary: RM1,800
Combined: RM3,800 (More likely to get approved!)
```

**Important:** Co-borrower is equally responsible for repayment. If you default, they must pay!

---

**4. Reduce Existing Debts**

**Calculate Your Debt Service Ratio (DSR):**

```
DSR = (Total Monthly Debt Payments ÷ Monthly Income) × 100%
```

**Example:**
```
Monthly salary: RM2,500
Motorcycle payment: RM300
Personal loan payment: RM400
Total debt payments: RM700

DSR = (RM700 ÷ RM2,500) × 100% = 28%
```

**Banks Want DSR Below 60%**

**If Your DSR is High, Do This:**
- Settle small debts first
- Extend existing loan tenure (reduce monthly payment)
- Ask family to take over some debt payments

---

**5. Apply During Festival Seasons**

**Best Times to Apply for Estate Workers:**

| Festival | Why Good? |
|----------|-----------|
| **Deepavali (October-November)** | Banks have special promotions for Indian community |
| **Chinese New Year (January-February)** | General loan promotions |
| **Hari Raya (May-June)** | Islamic banks offer special rates |

**Estate workers report 20-30% higher approval rates during festival seasons!**

---

**6. Use Guarantor**

**What is Guarantor?**
- Someone who promises to pay if you can't
- Must have better credit score and higher income
- உத்தரவாதம் அளிப்பவர் (Person who guarantees)

**Who Can Be Guarantor?**
- Family member with permanent job
- Friend working in government sector
- Anyone with clean CCRIS and CTOS

**Guarantor Requirements:**
```
✅ Malaysian citizen
✅ Age 21-60
✅ Minimum salary RM3,000
✅ Clean credit record
✅ Not bankrupt
✅ Willing to sign guarantee letter
```

---

**7. Show Additional Income Sources**

**Estate Workers Often Have Side Income:**
- Selling vegetables from small garden
- Part-time work on weekends
- Spouse's income from home business
- குடும்ப வருமானம் (Family income)

**How to Prove Additional Income?**
- Bank deposits from other sources
- Cash sales record (simple notebook)
- WhatsApp order screenshots (if selling online)
- Customer testimonials

**Example:**
"Mala from Batu Gajah estate sells homemade murukku (snacks). She showed her WhatsApp order messages and bank deposits totaling RM800/month. Combined with her RM2,200 estate salary, bank approved RM20,000 loan!"

---

**8. Apply for Smaller Amount First**

**Strategy:**
```
✅ Instead of applying for RM30,000, apply for RM10,000
✅ Banks more willing to approve smaller loans
✅ After 6 months of good repayment, apply for top-up
```

**Estate Worker Success Path:**
```
Step 1: Apply RM10,000 (APPROVED)
Step 2: Repay on time for 6 months
Step 3: Apply for RM20,000 top-up (APPROVED)
